To compile this C# code:

Save the code in a file with a .cs extension, for example, FileReader.cs.

Open a command prompt or terminal.

Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system.

Navigate to the directory containing your .cs file.

Run the following command to compile the code:

csc FileReader.cs
If you're using .NET Core or .NET 5+, you can use:


dotnet new console
Then replace the contents of the Program.cs file with your code, and run:


dotnet build
If there are no errors, this will produce an executable file named FileReader.exe (or just FileReader on non-Windows systems).

Run the compiled program:


FileReader.exe
Or for .NET Core/.NET 5+:

dotnet run


Remember to replace "example.txt" in the Main method with the actual path to the file you want to read.
